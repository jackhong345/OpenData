Experiments in our paper are designed to validate the proposed DRIR interpolation algorithm 
and check its performance in terms of the accuracy of the interpolated DOA and TOA. 

Four databases are utilized in these validations, including the real-world B-format recordings 
in a classroom and a great hall at the University of London, available at:
http://isophonics.org/content/room-impulse-response-data-set,

and simulated recordings for these two rooms using the image method, which were uploaded to
this Github repository.

Note:
Please cite our paper if you are interested in using our simulated recordings for further
development. The information of citation is:
